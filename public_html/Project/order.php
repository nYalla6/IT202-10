        Calculate Cart Items
        Verify the current product price against the Products table
        Since our Cart is table-based it can be long lived so if a user added a Product at a sale and they attempt to purchase afterwards, it should pull the true Product cost.
        You can also show the Cart.unit_price vs Product.unit_price to show a sale or an increase in price
        Verify desired product and desired quantity are still available in the Products table
        Users can’t purchase more than what’s in stock
        Show an error message and prevent order from going through if something isn’t available
        Let the user update their cart and try again
        Clearly show what the issue is (which product isn’t available, how much quantity is available if the cart exceeds it)
        Make an entry into the Orders table
        Get last Order ID from Orders table
        Copy the cart details into the OrderItems tables with the Order ID from the previous step
        Update the Products table Stock for each item to deduct the Ordered Quantity
        Clear out the user’s cart after successful order
        Redirect user to Order Confirmation Page
